# hateoflux (WIP!)

Lightweight HATEOAS library designed to work with Spring Webflux. This readme is currently just a todo list and will be
rewritten accordingly.

ℹ️ **Implementation of main logic is done. Documentation, build and publishing process remain**

## Implemented

* linkTo()
    * Manual (incl. slash())
    * On Controller with method selection
    * Expand templated URIs
    * Build query parameters in URI from Controller
    * Uses custom names for @PathVariable and @RequestParam
    * "templated" attribute is set depending on whether href is a template
    * Link.of(template string with _query_ parameters)
* Query parameters (@RequestParam) can be collections
    * Can be used either manually with Link.expand(href, map) or
    * with linkTo() on a Controller method. @Composite can be used to influence rendering of the list of variables (akin
      to Spring's @NonComposite)
* Representation model equivalents
    * EntityModel
    * CollectionModel
    * PagedModel
* Serialization
* Assemblers

## Currently out of scope

* Curie
* Affordance
* EntityLinks
* Representation Model Processors
* LinkRelationProvider
* Preconfigured default Link titles
* (Extended) Support for media types:
    * HAL-FORMS
    * Collection+Json
    * UBER - Uniform Basis for Exchanging Representations
    * ALPS - Application-Level Profile Semantics
* Client-side support (ideally not required as there should be out of the box support from Spring and other Libs)
* HalModelBuilder (Not necessary as Wrappers all come with a builder pattern)
